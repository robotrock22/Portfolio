    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="column">
      <p><span class="first">Born</span> and raised in Battle Ground, Washington. Raised by Randy and Denise Stuart along with my two sisters, Jamie and Lydia. While growing up I was encouraged to spend as much time outdoors. Whether it was sports, chores, or good ol' family fun we were all inspired to spend as much time possible outdoors in order to enjoy the beautiful Pacific Northwest that we call home.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <p><span class="first">2016</span> was an influential year for my journey. After an awakening of sorts I proceeded to dismantle the life I had built for myself. I had been living my life according to how I <span class="highlight">thought</span> an average American citizen should.
        <ul>
          <li>Go to school/Graduate</li>
          <li>Get a job</li>
          <li>Find a significant other</li>
          <li>Get married</li>
          <li>Buy house</li>
          <li>Have children</li>
          <li>Consume</li>
          <li>Die</li>
        </ul>
      Once I had dsimantled my previous life's foundation, I began to rebuild on the values that I find truly important.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <p><span class="first">With</span> a clean slate and no attachments to the past, I have been focusing on becoming the truest version of myself. For <span class="highlight">myself</span> this has required an adventure into the spiritual world. Running, yoga, meditation, and a plant-based diet have been the foundation. From there I decided to pursue a career in an industry that will allow me to travel so that I'm able to chase different ultra-marathon races around the world. My hope is to break out of the amatuer division of racing in order to become a sponsored ultra runner. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <p><span class="first">My</span> hope is that pursuing a career in programming will allow me to align with a company that not only holds similar values as myself, but will also allow me to work remotely. With the option of working remotely I will be able to travel to races without the burden of going to an office for work. Not only will I be able to chase races, but I will also have more flexibility with my training schedule. As I'm sure you can imagine, racing distances of 50, 100, or 200 miles requires a great deal of commitment and sacrifice.</p>
